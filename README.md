# Tekton + blog

I have created this repo to share a example pipeline that I have built for a customer.

It's used as a reference in my blog.

Due to that I haven't provided any way of setting up the needed infrastructure surrounding the setup I have two folders of each example.

One for the people reading the blog that want to test it out without setting up artifactory, bitbucket and configuring these services.
So instead they can just clone from github.
